üéØ Problem Solved
In microservice architectures, services communicate through API contracts (schemas). When these schemas change, it can break dependent services. This tool provides:

Real-time tracking of schema changes across services
Automatic detection of breaking changes
Visual dependency mapping between services
Deployment monitoring with status tracking

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Frontend: React, D3.js
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: SQLite
Integrations: StreamSynth (data processing), PipelinePulse (deployment monitoring)
Deployment: Render

‚ú® Key Features
Schema Management

Register and version schemas
Detect breaking vs non-breaking changes
Track schema evolution history

Deployment Tracking

Monitor deployments across environments (dev, staging, prod)
Track deployment status (success, failed, monitoring)
Prevent breaking changes from reaching production

Dependency Visualization

Interactive service dependency graph
Impact analysis for schema changes
Visual representation of microservice architecture

üß™ Try It Yourself - Step by Step Demo
Follow these steps to see the core features in action:
Step 1: Register Your First Schema

In the "Register New Schema" form, enter:

Schema Name: ProductSchema
Version: 1.0.0
Service: product-service
Schema Content:

json{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "productId": { "type": "string" },
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "price": { "type": "number" },
    "description": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["productId", "name", "price"]
}

Click "Register Schema"

‚úÖ What you'll see: The schema appears in the "Recent Schemas" section, and the schema count increases.
Step 2: Add a Non-Breaking Change

Register version 1.1.0 with an optional field:

Schema Name: ProductSchema
Version: 1.1.0
Service: product-service
Schema Content:

json{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "productId": { "type": "string" },
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "price": { "type": "number" },
    "description": { "type": "string" },
    "brand": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["productId", "name", "price"]
}

Click "Register Schema"

‚úÖ What you'll see: A success message with "Compatible Changes Only" - adding optional fields is safe.
Step 3: Create a Breaking Change

Register version 2.0.0 with breaking changes:

Schema Name: ProductSchema
Version: 2.0.0
Service: product-service
Schema Content:

json{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "productId": { "type": "string" },
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "cost": { "type": "number" },
    "brand": { "type": "string" },
    "category": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["productId", "name", "cost", "category"]
}

Click "Register Schema"

‚úÖ What you'll see:

Red alert: "Breaking Changes Detected!"
Detailed analysis showing:

FIELD_REMOVED: Field 'price' was removed
REQUIRED_ADDED: Field 'category' is now required



This demonstrates the core value: The system caught dangerous changes before they could break other services!
Step 4: Deploy a Schema

In the "Deploy Schema" section:

Select: ProductSchema v1.0.0 (product-service)
Environment: dev


Click "Create Deployment"

‚úÖ What you'll see:

Success message
Deployment appears in "Recent Deployments" with PENDING status
After 3 seconds, refresh the page - status changes to SUCCESS

Step 5: Create Service Dependencies

In the "Register Dependency" form:

Producer Service: product-service
Consumer Service: search-service
Schema Name: ProductSchema


Click "Register Dependency"

‚úÖ What you'll see:

Dependencies count increases
The dependency graph updates showing the connection
Services count increases as new services are discovered

üìä What This Demonstrates

Schema Evolution: How APIs change over time (v1.0.0 ‚Üí v1.1.0 ‚Üí v2.0.0)
Change Detection: Automatic identification of breaking changes
Safety Mechanism: Preventing dangerous deployments
Service Mesh: Visual representation of service dependencies
Deployment Pipeline: Tracking schema deployments across environments

üí° Real-World Value
This tool helps teams:

Prevent Outages: Catch breaking changes before production
Improve Communication: Visualize service dependencies
Track Changes: Maintain schema history
Coordinate Deployments: See what's deployed where

üîÆ Future Enhancements
Support for GraphQL schemas
Integration with CI/CD pipelines
